SpringBoot Application built by Mohan Chaitanya Kolla

Introduction:
● In this architecture, there are three main components: controller, service, and repository.
Each component comprises three parts: job, company, and review.
● The controller component is connected with the browser, facilitating interaction with the
user. Meanwhile, the repository component is linked to the database, enabling data
storage and retrieval. Responses are provided to the user accordingly from the
database.
● Additionally, the server is hosted within this architecture, handling incoming requests and
managing the flow of data.
● Within the job, company, and review parts, there are methods designed to execute
actions based on user requests, ensuring the system functions as intended.
RUN FILE) FirstJobappApplication.java file
Initializes and starts the Spring Boot application by running the main method, which in turn calls
SpringApplication.run(), triggering the application's startup process.

SUMMARY
1A)Description of Job.java file
● This Java code defines a class named Job in the package com.mohan.firstjobapp.job.
● This class represents a job entity in a job application system or similar application.
Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
● Annotations: @Entity: Indicates that this class is a JPA (Java Persistence API) entity
and will be mapped to a database table. @Id: Specifies the primary key of the entity.
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY): Specifies that the primary key
values are generated by the database. @ManyToOne: Indicates a many-to-one
relationship between Job and Company entities. This means many jobs can belong to
one company.
● Fields: id: Primary key of the job entity. title: Title of the job. description: Description of
the job. minSalary: Minimum salary offered for the job. maxSalary: Maximum salary
offered for the job. location: Location of the job. company: The company offering the job.
This is represented as a Company object.
● Constructors: Default constructor. Parameterized constructor that initializes all fields of
the Job class.
● Getter and Setter Methods: Getters and setters for all fields, including id, title,
description, minSalary, maxSalary, location, and company.
1B)Description of JobController.java file
● Annotations: @RestController: Indicates that this class is a REST controller, meaning it
handles HTTP requests and returns JSON/XML responses. @RequestMapping("/jobs"):
Specifies that all endpoints in this controller are relative to the /jobs path.
● Fields: private JobService jobService: A field of type JobService, presumably for
handling business logic related to job entities.
● Constructor: Initializes the JobController with a JobService instance.
● Methods:
findAll(): Handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve all jobs. Returns a ResponseEntity
with a list of jobs and an HTTP status code.
createJob(): Handles HTTP POST requests to create a new job. Expects a JSON
representation of the job in the request body. Returns a ResponseEntity with a success
message and an HTTP status code.
getJobById(): Handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve a specific job by its ID. Expects
the job ID as a path variable. Returns a ResponseEntity with the job if found, or a 404
status code if not found.
deleteJob(): Handles HTTP DELETE requests to delete a job by its ID. Expects the job
ID as a path variable. Returns a ResponseEntity with a success message if the job is
deleted, or a 404 status code if the job is not found.
updateJob(): Handles HTTP PUT requests to update an existing job. Expects the job ID
as a path variable and the updated job details in the request body. Returns a
ResponseEntity with a success message if the job is updated, or a 404 status code if the
job is not found.
1C)Description of JobService.java file
Here's what each method in the JobService interface indicates:
● findAll(): This method is intended to retrieve all jobs. It returns a list of Job objects.
● createJob(Job job): This method is intended to create a new job. It takes a Job object
as a parameter.
● getJobId(Long id): This method is intended to retrieve a specific job by its ID. It takes
the job ID as a parameter and returns the corresponding Job object.
● deleteJobById(Long id): This method is intended to delete a job by its ID. It takes the
job ID as a parameter and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the deletion was
successful.

job. It takes the job ID and the updated job object as parameters and returns a Boolean
value indicating whether the update was successful.
1D)Description of JobRepository.java file
● JpaRepository<Job, Long>: This is a generic interface provided by Spring Data JPA.
It is parameterized with two types:
Job: The entity type that this repository manages. In this case, it's the Job entity.
Long: The type of the primary key of the entity (Job). In this case, it indicates that the
primary key is of type Long.
● By extending JpaRepository<Job, Long>, the JobRepository interface inherits several
methods for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the Job entity.
These methods include saving, deleting, and finding entities, among others.
